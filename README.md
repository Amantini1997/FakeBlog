## Road map

- Posts currently display the title and a number, which is the userId.
That userId should be mapped to an actual username.
- Comments currently display a "Label" placeholder.
That placeholder should be the username of the user who published the comment.
- Lazy loading should be introduced in the home page.
- Lazy loading should be introduced for routing and so Angular pages should be implemented.
